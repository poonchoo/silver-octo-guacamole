  	<h1>Welcome to my site</h1>
  	<p> Hi welcome to my website where I show what I can and can't do. Well at least I don't have to look
    at that awful eslint error while on Atom. I don't even know how I'm going to fix that.</p>
    <p>
      I am currently in the middle of learning web programming, reviewing it after my course in <thead>
        Spring. I have interests in UI/UX and full stack programming, but I still have much to learn.
