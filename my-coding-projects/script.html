          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p> Hi welcome to my website where I show what I can and can't do. Well at least I don't have to look
          at that awful eslint error while on Atom. I don't even know how I'm going to fix that.</p>

        <h2>Some Info</h2>
         <p>
          I am currently in the middle of learning web programming, reviewing it after my course in
          Spring. I have interests in UI/UX and full stack programming, but I still have much to learn.
          Like how do you open html on Atom in browser I would have this problem if VScode doesn't have
          ESlint installed i hate that thing from the bottom of my heart
         </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Update!</h2>
          <p>I finally figured out how to remove that lintr on VSCode! It took me a while but then I realized
            it wasn't a package that I downloaded, but it was an extension instead! Now without lintr I can use
            VSCode without gouging my eyes out because of the unnecessary red lines that plague my HTML files.
